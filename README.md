# LUMA Meta Hackathon - 2024

VISTA is an AI-powered browser extension that enables visually impaired individuals to interact seamlessly with any website. It was developed during the Meta AI Llama Hackathon held in Toronto in November 2024. It uses a transformer-based web scraper to extract information from websites, regardless of their structure, and combines this with the Llama 3.1-8B model to generate accurate, context-aware answers. By leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), VISTA ensures that responses are both relevant and precise. With integrated speech-to-text and text-to-speech models, users can engage in conversation, making the process of obtaining information feel more natural. LUMA_2024
